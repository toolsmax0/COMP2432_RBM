    \section{Introduction}
        \paragraph{}
        The project aims to utilize the knowledge covered in COMP2432 Operating Systems
        and put them into practice to get a further understanding and improvement. This
        works out by implementing a facility management system for a company, which
        would make advantage of all kinds of scheduling skills and abstractions covered
        in the lecture, along with the use of multi-process programming and inter-process
        communication. 
    \cleardoublepage
    \section{Scope}
        \subsection{Multi-Process Programming and Inter-process Communication}
            \paragraph{}
            Scheduling module is implemented as a child process created via fork(). The communication between parent and scheduling module is based on pipe(), write(), and read(). In addition, in order to deliver complex information, we use pointers and pipes together.
        \subsection{ CPU Scheduling}
            \paragraph{}
            In this project, we are required to implement FCFS and prio algorithm for component booking, which is similar to what we learned in lectures about CPU Scheduling. However, there are some difference between algorithms in CPU scheduling and booking scheduling. In booking scheduling, we only care about the order of coming request and don't mind exact arrival time. In CPU scheduling, processes can be finished while in booking scheduling, requests can't be finished during the scheduling. Thus, the method to implement booking scheduling algorithms is similar to but still differs from CPU scheduling.
        \subsection{Memory Allocation}
            \paragraph{}
            Thinking of rooms as fixed partitions and requests as jobs, the process of allocating rooms for requests has the same logic as Multi-programming with a Fixed number of Tasks, where we have fixed amount of resources which is divided into certain numbers of partitions, and our task is to allocate different amounts of resources for objects in need of resources.
        \subsection{Synchronization}
            \paragraph{}
            Program-Monitored Synchronization is used for synchronization.
    \cleardoublepage
    \section{Concept}
        \subsection{FCFS Scheduling}
            \paragraph{}
                FCFS scheduling is indeed taking the arriving time of the request as the
                priority. It is very easy to implement this algorithm, as long as the
                order of the request array is the same order as input, which is very
                natural. To implement this algorithm, we only need to checks the availability of the required resources for each request in positive order. One thing to note that to keep the order of request array the
                same as input order, Input Module must be single-threaded. 
        \subsection{PRIO Scheduling}
            \paragraph{}
            It is already mentioned that FCFS is a special case of PRIO scheduling where
            the priority is the arriving time. Now that a priority is appended with the
            request, all it needs is to sort the request array by priority, then call
            FCFS scheduling to implement PRIO scheduling. This reuses the code and
            decrease the complexity of the program.

    \section{Testing Cases}
        \paragraph{}
        This is the brief version. 
        \paragraph{}
        Below demonstrates the valid and invalid tests for addMeeting instruction.
        \paragraph{}
        Tests for other instructions are similar but vary in parameters. 
        \paragraph{}
        Refer to appendix for full version. 

        \paragraph{valid tests}
        \begin{verbatim}
            // the valid syntax is: 
            // addMeeting â€“tenant YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm n.n [d1 d2]; 
            addMeeting -tenant_A 2021-05-10 21:50 1.50 5 projector_2K screen_100;

            // command is invalid
            command_invalid and parameters does not matter;
            // tenant invalid
            addMeeting -tenant_invalid 2021-05-10 1:30 0.50 5 projector_2K screen_100;
